## CPF Optimization

### Understanding Your CPF Accounts

#### Account Types
- **Ordinary Account (OA)**: Housing, education, investments
- **Special Account (SA)**: Retirement, investment in retirement-related products
- **MediSave Account (MA)**: Healthcare expenses
- **Retirement Account (RA)**: Created at 55, for retirement payouts

### CPF Hacks & Strategies

#### 1. CPF Top-Ups for Tax Relief
- **Cash Top-Up to SA**: Up to $8,000 tax relief
- **Parents' Top-Up**: Additional $8,000 tax relief
- **Total Potential**: $16,000 tax relief annually

```
Example: $8,000 top-up at 30% tax bracket = $2,400 tax savings
Plus 4% SA interest = $320/year compound growth
```

#### 2. CPF Shielding (Before 55)
- Invest OA in property to shield from Retirement Account
- SA earns 4% vs RA at 4% (but locked till 65)

#### 3. Voluntary Housing Refund
- Refund OA used for housing to earn higher interest
- Useful when property is fully paid

#### 4. CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS)
- Only invest if confident of beating 2.5% (OA) or 4% (SA)
- Consider STI ETF for long-term growth

### Age-Based CPF Strategies

| Age | Strategy |
|-----|----------|
| 20-30 | Focus on OA accumulation for housing |
| 30-40 | Balance between housing and SA top-ups |
| 40-50 | Maximize SA for compound interest |
| 50-55 | Consider CPF shielding strategies |
| 55+ | Optimize between BRS/FRS/ERS |

## Housing Strategies

### HDB vs Private Property

#### First-Time Buyers
1. **BTO**: Cheapest option, 4-year wait
2. **SBF**: Faster than BTO, limited choices
3. **Resale**: Immediate but pricier
4. **EC**: Middle ground between HDB and private

### Maximizing Grants

#### HDB Grants Checklist
- [ ] Enhanced CPF Housing Grant (up to $80k)
- [ ] Proximity Grant ($30k living with parents)
- [ ] Singles Grant (for 35+ singles)
- [ ] Step-Up Grant (for second-timers)

### Property Progression Strategy
